How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Testing, both statically and dynamically, are great ways to ensure that the software I create works properly and is secure. Thorough testing is an integral step in the SDLC and is wholly necessary, no matter how simple the project may seem. If a program is not tested properly, it could put the user and the company in danger, leaving them vulnerable to attacks or bugs that break the whole system. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Whenever I create a program, I first examine the requirements. After determining what my program needs to do, I then outline how to structure the code so the goals of the program are clearly met before the actual coding process even begins. The next step is to create the program, and after that task has been completed, I test the code to make sure it lives up to its requirements properly. In the case of this project, I used JUnit tests to ensure that my program functioned properly and logically correct. 

How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software in a similar fashion for most projects. First, I analyze the requirements, then I puzzle out how they can best be met. After determining how the requirements will be met, I create the code and fashion the different methods together into a cohesive and efficient program. Finally, I test the program using static testing techniques such as visually analyzing the code to ensure that the logic is sound, and utilizing dynamic testing techniques such as creating a JUnit test to ensure that the methods I have created actually work.
